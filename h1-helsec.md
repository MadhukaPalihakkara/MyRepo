# Helsec presentation
 Helsec presentation is about invoice fraud. Invoice fraud ranks as the second most impactful scam in the US, as reported last year. This fraud often target on human vulnerabilities, unsuspecting errors, lack of awareness, or trust in routine processes. There is an interesting walk-through of a practical simulation of how invoice fraud might occur using Phishing emails, in Helsec presentation. Such simulations would be much more productive in employee awareness activities.  
 
The primary goal of invoice fraud is to trick the target organization into transferring funds to fake accounts. Here are some common techniques used in invoice fraud.   
Fack Invoices - Sending invoices for services never provided to a company.
Altered Invoices - Actual invoices with valid invoice numbers and altered payment details (bank account numbers).
Phishing emails - Use phishing emails to trick employees into changing payment details in systems.
Impersonation - Pretend as an actual supplier or vendor to submit invoices.
Ghosting - Non-existing employees or suppliers are added to the payroll.

To prevent invoice fraud we have to minimize human errors and trust in routine work mainly. It can be achieved through employee awareness, defining a strict verification process while adding/updating supplier or vendor details, involving multiple staff members in the payment process (for approvals and verifications), and implementing secure communication to avoid manipulations.
