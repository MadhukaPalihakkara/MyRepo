### How The Onion Router Works

•	Tor Routing Process directs user's Internet traffic through random relays on the Internet.

•	At the start data is encrypted with elliptic curve cryptography, which is like a strong layer of protection.

•	Then, it goes through three stops, entry, middle, and exit relays. At each stop, one layer of protection is taken off. 

•	Finally, at the exit relay, the data connects to its destination without the extra layers,

•	Exit relay is only aware of the last previous node and nothing about traffic route.

•	And the route change entry, middle, and exit relays every 10 minutes.
