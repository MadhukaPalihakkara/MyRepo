### Digital signatures 

•	Digital signature is a digital version of the handwritten signature.

•	Securing the content with a digital signature has three phases, which are preparation, signing and verification.

•	Private key and public key are a key pair, which can be used to encrypt and decrypt messages.

•	Encrypted by private key and decrypted by public key, is used as a digital signature implementation.

•	Encrypted by a public key and decrypted by a private key, is used as a way of secure communication.

•	A signature is an encrypted hash.

•	Keeping the private key secure is an individual responsibility.

•	Keeping the private key secure is challenging while knowing that if you lose the private key it will not be recovered or regenerated.

Pgp - Encryption tool
Micro - A Linux terminal based text editor that sits in-between vim and nano tools in terms of complexity
Psmisc - is a combination of small usable tools as describe below
    fuser  - reports the PIDs of processes that use the given files or filesystems.
    killall  - kills processes by name. It sends a signal to all processes running any of the given commands.
    Pidof  - reports the PIDs of the given programs. (Not this pidof program is used, however, but the one from Sysvinit.)
    Pstree -  displays running processes as a tree
